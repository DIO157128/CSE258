predict_read(): This function predicts whether a user would read a book (1 for yes, 0 for no). It uses two criteria: the book's popularity (based on how many users have interacted with it) and the Jaccard similarity between the given book and books the user has already interacted with. Popular books or those with a similarity above the threshold are recommended. The predictions are written to a file for further evaluation.
predict_rating(): This function predicts user ratings for books using the SVD++ algorithm. It trains a collaborative filtering model on the provided interaction data and predicts ratings for specific user-book pairs. The output includes estimated ratings for each pair, which are written to a predictions file for further analysis.
